# This is a Sass Project 
## I watched a tutorial on Sass on a Youtube channel called Traversy Media to learn the basics of Sass. While watching i took some notes to grasp the subject, watched it again, wrote the code and played with it by changing some scss mainly and added comments. Brad Traversy does a great job explaining Sass in this video.

## 5 aspects/tools of Sass that i found useful:
  - How easy it is to change and control colors with Sass. 
  - Changing either $primary-color or $secondary-colors for example. And how easily it changes through the whole project.
  - Using @mixin to set a background & text color, i thought that was pretty cool. How you are able to write your styles and use through the whole project.
  - $spaceamounts for margin and padding is a nice variable to use for that purpose.  
  -  @media for making sure that the media content is displaying in a responsive way.
