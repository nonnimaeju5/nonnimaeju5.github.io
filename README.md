# This is a Sass Project 
## I watched a couple of tutorials related to Sass on a Youtube and read some articles to learn the basics of Sass. While watching and reading i took down notes to grasp the subject better, then i collected Sass tools that i think are pretty cool, after that i wrote the code and added comments.

## 5 aspects/tools of Sass that i found useful:
  - How easy it is to change and control colors with Sass. 
  - Changing either $primary-color or $secondary-colors for example. And how easily it changes through the whole project.
  - Using @mixin to set a background & text color, i thought that was pretty cool. How you are able to write your styles and use through the whole project.
  - $spaceamounts for margin and padding is a nice variable to use for that purpose.  
  -  @media for making sure that the media content is displaying in a responsive way.
